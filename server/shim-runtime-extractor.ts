/**
 * Shim Runtime Extractor
 *
 * This module handles the extraction of bundled shim files at runtime for
 * standalone executables. When compiled with Bun, shim files are embedded
 * in the executable and need to be extracted to disk before they can be
 * spawned as subprocesses.
 *
 * The extraction is done to a versioned directory to avoid re-extraction
 * on every run and to handle version updates cleanly.
 *
 * Build Process:
 * The build script (scripts/build-executable.ts) embeds shim files using:
 *   bun build --compile --embed shims/gemini/index.js ...
 *
 * Note: We use .js extension instead of .mjs for better embedding compatibility.
 *
 * At runtime, these embedded files are accessible via Bun.file() using their
 * original paths.
